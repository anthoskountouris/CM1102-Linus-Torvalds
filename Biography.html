     <div>
    <p class="margin">  Linus Torvalds is a Computer Scientist and programmer who is 
                    known for his development of the Linux operating system. He 
                    was born in Helsinki, Finland in December 28,1969. His 
                    parents are Nils and Anna Torvalds and his wife Tove Torvalds 
                    with whom he has 3 children.</p>

    <p>  His interest in computers began when he was 10 years old when 
                    he got his grandfather’s computer. He purchased his first computer 
                    in 1988 while he was a Computer Science student but he was not satisfied
                    with the computer’s operating system. </p>

    <p>  So, he decided to build his own PC-based version of Unix, the Linux. 
                    The first version of Linux was released by 1994 after the help of many 
                    programmers in retooling and refining the software.</p>
